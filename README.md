The purpose of this software, is a smart, sleek and minimalistic inventory-app. 
Just add the categories of items you want to keep track of, add the items itself and voila!

Easy and fast way to change the amount of items/products and to keep track of all.

In a future-version, notifications when a items reaches a specified amount, will be added, aswell as the ability to import and export your database, or even managing multiple databases at once!

WIP: i am mostly confused what i am doing, so right now, most of it is just a placeholder, i will need to add the database itself, the logic to use the database and the whole "here you can add | delete | edit your products or categories", lol :D
